# ensure commands like `ncdump` are available:
#use -r -e netcdf-c-4.2.1.1

# python3 is required:
#use -r -e anaconda-6

# This is actually installed as a Python environment.
# In a user shell it can also be accessed this way:
# conda activate cdo_nco_anaconda_6
# conda deactivate 

# Path must be updated to use the environment's executables:
# These were found from "conda info --envs"
prepend PATH /apps/share64/debian7/anaconda/anaconda-6/envs/cdo_nco_anaconda_6/bin
