# This is actually installed as a Python environment.
# In a user shell it can also be accessed this way:
# conda activate xarray_anaconda_6
# conda deactivate 

# Path must be updated to use the environment's executables:
# These were found from "conda info --envs"
# should also bring in libraries to the PYTHONPATH. 
# fetched from saying 'import sys' then print (join(sys.path))
